  <introduction>
    <p> In our earlier course, we investigated diagonalizable matrices
    and used them to simplify a variety of problems.  Remember we said
    that the matrix <m>A</m> is <em>diagonalizable</em> if there is a
    diagonal matrix <m>D</m> and an invertible matrix <m>P</m> such
    that <m>A=PDP^{-1}</m>.  We would now say that <m>A</m> is similar
    to the diagonal matrix <m>D</m>.
    </p>

    <p>We also saw that not every matrix is diagonalizable.  However,
    when <m>A</m> is symmetric, then <m>A</m> is not only
    diagonalizable, but it is <em>orthogonally diagonalizable</em>,
    meaning there is an orthogonal matrix <m>Q</m> such that
    <m>A=QDQ^T</m>.  This was an important fact that led to many
    interesting ideas, and we called it the <em>Spectral
    Theorem</em>.
    </p>

    <p>We can rephrase the Spectral Theorem now that we are
    investigating vector spaces and linear 
    transformations.  In particular, if <m>T</m> is an operator
    that is represented by a symmetric matrix <m>A</m>
    in some basis, then there is another basis for which the matrix
    representing <m>T</m> is diagonal.
    </p>

    <p>This chapter presents a proof of the Spectral Theorem.
    Furthermore, we will go further and study operators to which the
    Spectral Theorem does not apply.  In this case, can we find a
    basis such that the matrix representing the transformation has a
    simple form?  For example, if we cannot represent <m>T</m> with a
    diagonal matrix, perhaps we can represent it with an
    upper-triangular one.
