  <title>Vector spaces</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Our previous linear algebra course focused on vectors in
    <m>\real^n</m>, which we thought of as a list of <m>n</m> real
    numbers, such as <m>\vvec=\threevec2{-1}4</m>.  An essential part
    of our study were two algebraic operations performed on vectors:
    scalar multiplication and vector addition.
    </p>

    <p>In addition to vectors, we also considered matrices and their
    associated matrix transformations.  At times, we also considered
    scalar multiplication and addition of matrices.  For instance,
    when studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix
    <m>A</m>, we may have constructed the associated matrix
    <m>A-2I</m>.  In other words, we multiplied the matrix <m>I</m> by
    the scalar <m>-2</m> and then added <m>A</m>.
    </p>

    <p>In fact, there are other types of mathematical objects for
    which we can define operations like scalar multiplication and
    vector addition.  Polynomials are a good example.  If <m>p(x)=2x^2
    - 4</m> and <m>q(x)=x+7</m>, then we can multiply <m>p(x)</m> by a
    scalar and add two polynomials:
    <md>
      <mrow>3p(x)\amp=6x^2 - 12 </mrow>
      <mrow>p(x)+q(x)\amp=2x^2+x+3 </mrow>
    </md>
    </p>

    <p>Our first task in this course is to generalize our earlier
    work with vectors in <m>\real^n</m> and matrices to things like
    polynomials.  This leads us to the idea of a vector space.
